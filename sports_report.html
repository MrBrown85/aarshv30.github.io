Michael Bennett is a great addition to the Eagles Frontline of Brandon Graham, Jake Long, and Fletcher Cox. He will get Double-teamed less because of the talent that the Eagles have on their defensive line leading to him averaging more sacks a season.</p>

  <h2><center>Derrick Rose Signs with Timberwolves</center></h2>
  <p>Derrick Rose signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves. This pick up for the Timberwolves is huge because Derrick has the potential to become an amazing role player. Derrick could not thrive on the Cavaliers leading him to get traded but Tom Thibodeau is an amazing coach which will guarantee him success in the NBA.</p>
